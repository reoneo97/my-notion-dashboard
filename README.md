# my-notion-dashboard

In this project, I use the Notion API and Streamlit to create a dashboard to monitor my progress and visualise certain key metrics that I am tracking daily. Besides that I hope to also use certain NLP analytics to identify how my reflections are progressing and identify if there are any common themes/patterns in my daily journaling

This project uses the Notion API and Streamlit to create a dashboard for tracking and monitoring of key metrics. 
Notion Databases allow you to create pages where each page has certain properties, and this is a great way to track things daily. 

Besides looking at the Database properties I am also trying to see if I can perform any analytics regarding the text that I write and the metrics through unsupervised learning.
