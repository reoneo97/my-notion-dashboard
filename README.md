# my-notion-dashboard

In this project, I use the Notion API and Streamlit to create a dashboard to monitor my progress and visualise certain key metrics that I am tracking daily. Besides that I hope to also use certain NLP analytics to identify how my reflections are progressing and identify if there are any common themes/patterns in my daily journaling
